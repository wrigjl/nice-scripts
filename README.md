# nice-scripts
scripts for interacting with the nicehash API

Put your `api_key`, `api_secret`, and `org_id` in a file called `nicehash.json` and then use to your
heart's content.

 - `nh-power`: sums the power usage of all devices in the group `op`
 - `nh-withdrawl.py`: attempt to withdraw funds via script

TODO: make `nh-power`'s group configurable via command line
